üåü Introduction
Welcome to the Todo Application! This is a complete web application that helps you manage your daily tasks with ease. Think of it like a digital to-do list that you can access from anywhere. The application has two main parts:

Frontend: The part you see and interact with (built with React)

Backend: The "brain" that stores your tasks and handles all the behind-the-scenes work (built with Node.js and PostgreSQL)

The application is designed to be secure, fast, and easy to use, whether you're a tech expert or just getting started with digital tools.

‚ú® Features
User Accounts: Create an account and log in securely

Task Management:

Add new tasks with titles and descriptions

Mark tasks as complete

Edit existing tasks

Delete tasks you no longer need

Organized Display: View all your tasks in a clean, easy-to-read list

Responsive Design: Works well on both computers and mobile devices

Secure: Your data is protected with modern security measures

üõ† Technology Stack
Here's what makes this application work:

Frontend (What you see)
React: A popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces

React Router: Handles navigation between different pages

Axios: Helps the frontend communicate with the backend

CSS: Makes everything look nice and organized

Backend (The brain)
Node.js: The JavaScript runtime that powers the backend

Express: A framework that helps organize the backend code

PostgreSQL: A powerful database that stores all your tasks

JWT: Securely handles user authentication

Infrastructure
Docker: Packages the application for easy deployment

Docker Compose: Manages multiple containers (frontend, backend, database)

GitHub Actions: Automates testing and deployment

üöÄ Setup Instructions
Prerequisites
Before you begin, make sure you have these installed:

Docker

Docker Compose

Node.js (version 18 or higher)

Git

Step-by-Step Setup
Clone the repository:

bash
git clone https://github.com/your-repository/todo-app.git
cd todo-app
Set up environment variables:

Create a .env file in both backend and frontend folders

For the backend, use the example from backend.txt (but change the sensitive values!)

For the frontend, you might need to set REACT_APP_API_URL

Build and run with Docker:

bash
docker-compose up --build
Access the application:

Frontend: Open http://localhost:3000 in your browser

Backend: Runs on http://localhost:5000 (you won't access this directly)

‚ñ∂ Running the Application
Once everything is set up:

Development mode:

bash
# For backend
cd backend
npm run dev

# For frontend (in another terminal)
cd frontend
npm start
Production mode:

bash
docker-compose up -d
The application will automatically:

Create database tables if they don't exist

Set up all necessary connections

Handle user authentication securely

üß© Understanding the Components
Frontend Structure
App.js: The main component that ties everything together

AuthContext.js: Manages user login state

Components:

Auth/: Handles login and registration

Todo/: Manages the to-do list interface

Layout/: Contains shared elements like the header

Backend Structure
server.js: The entry point that starts the server

app.js: Configures the application (security, routes, etc.)

Routes:

auth.js: Handles user registration and login

todos.js: Manages all to-do related operations

Models:

User.js: Handles user data

Todo.js: Manages to-do items in the database

Controllers: Contain the business logic for each route

üîí Security Measures
Your security is important! Here's how we protect your data:

Password Protection:

Passwords are never stored directly - they're converted to secure hashes

Uses bcryptjs for strong password encryption

Authentication:

Uses JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for secure login

Tokens expire after 7 days for safety

API Protection:

Rate limiting to prevent abuse (100 requests every 15 minutes)

Helmet middleware for secure HTTP headers

CORS restricted to your frontend only

Database Security:

SSL connections for production

Sensitive data stored in environment variables

‚òÅ Deployment
The application includes a GitHub Actions pipeline that automatically:

Tests the code

Builds Docker images

Pushes them to Docker Hub

Deploys to your server when you push to the main branch

Manual Deployment Steps
Build the images:

bash
docker-compose build
Run the containers:

bash
docker-compose up -d
View running containers:

bash
docker ps
View logs:

bash
docker logs todo-backend
docker logs todo-frontend
üö® Troubleshooting
Common Issues
Connection errors:

Check that PostgreSQL is running

Verify your .env file has correct database credentials

Ensure ports 3000 (frontend) and 5000 (backend) are available

Docker issues:

Make sure Docker is running (docker --version)

Try rebuilding images (docker-compose up --build)

Database problems:

Check the backend logs for connection errors

Verify the database tables were created (look for "Database tables created successfully" in logs)

Getting Help
If you encounter issues:

Check the logs (as shown above)

Search for your error message online

Open an issue in the GitHub repository with details of your problem
